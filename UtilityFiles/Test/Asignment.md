# Build a set of services to get and set employees

## Task

This task is to create a simple console app to `get` and `set` employee data.

The app should be built in dotnet core 3.1

e.g.

* dotnet run set-employee --employeeId 2 --employeeName John --employeeSalary 333
* dotnet run get-employee --employeeId 2

## Database

There are tools included to set up and tear down a postgres database using docker:

 * Setup database: ./setUpDatabase.ps1
 * Database schema: ./DatabaseSchema/dbSchema.sql

If you choose to use a different database, that is fine, just include details in your submission.

## Time travelling

Employee records are a snapshot in time, and the `get` service will be required to get an employee record "as it appeared at a point in time". This is accounted for in the database schema, where `existencestartutc` is the time that an employee record is valid from, and `existenceendutc` is the time that an employee record is valid to.

## Interface parameters

These are the methods that the console app must support, along with the arguments that are required.

### get-employee

 1. --employeeId, INT, Mandatory
 2. --simulatedTimeUtc, DateTime, Optional, Default = Now

### set-employee

 1. --employeeId, INT, Mandatory
 2. --employeeName, STRING Mandatory
 3. --employeeSalary, INT Mandatory

## Testing your submissions

 * The submission will require tests
 * The script ./verifySubmission.ps1 can verify that functionality is complete
